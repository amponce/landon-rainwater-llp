#### Brad Jefferson Landon

In 1995, I began practicing law full time and quickly built a successful medium size law firm of five attorneys. I wasn’t satisfied with the growing firm and felt I had lost touch with the most important part of practicing law–client relationships. As a result, I moved to Temecula in 2003 to start fresh with a focus on keeping things small, intimate and simple. If you are looking for an attorney who is like a “regular guy,” then I am the attorney for you.

#### Rebecca Rainwater

If you’re looking for an attorney who values close client relationships, you’ve come to the right place. With over 20 years of experience, I understand the importance of amicable resolutions; however, if faced with an unreasonable opposition, I will fight hard for you as my client toward the just result you deserve.
