## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. **Setup your enviroment.**

Clone the repo to local development directory

```sh
git clone https://github.com/amponce/landon-rainwater-llp
```

2. **Start developing.**

Navigate into project directory and start it up.

```sh
cd landon-rainwater-llp
gatsby develop
```

3. **Open the code and start customizing!**

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

#### Adding a new blog post

New blog posts will be shown on the index page (the three most recent ones) of this theme and on the blog overview page. They can be added by creating MDX files inside `content/posts`. General setup:

1. Create a new folder inside `content/posts`
1. Create a new `index.mdx` file, and add the frontmatter
1. Add images to the created folder (from step 1) you want to reference in your blog post
1. Reference an image as your `banner` in the frontmatter
1. Write your content below the frontmatter

**Frontmatter reference:**

```md
---
title: Has Coronavirus Unraveled American Business
date: 2020-11-12
tags:
  - Covid
  - Business
banner: ./defence-against-the-dark-arts.jpg
---
```

**The fields `description` and `banner` are optional!** If no description is provided, an excerpt of the blog post will be used. If no banner is provided, the default `siteImage` (from `siteMetadata`) is used.

The `date` field has to be written in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`!

#### Adding a new page

Additional pages can be created by placing MDX files inside `contents/pages`, e.g. an "About" or "Contact" page. You'll manually need to link to those pages, for example by adding them to the navigation (in `navigation` option of the theme). General instructions:

1. Create a new folder inside `content/pages`
1. Create a new `index.mdx` file, and add the frontmatter
1. Write your content below the frontmatter
1. Optionally add files/images to the folder you want to reference from the page

**Frontmatter reference:**

```md
---
title: About
slug: '/about'
---
```

### Change your `static` folder

The `static` folder contains the icons, social media images and robots.txt. Don't forget to change these files, too!
